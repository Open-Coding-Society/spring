## Backend UI purpose

This Backend UI is to manage adminstrative functions like reseting passwords and managing database content: CRUD, Backup, and Restore.

- Thymeleaf UI should be visual and practical
- Home page is organized with Bootstrap menu and cards
- Most menus and operations are dedicated to Tables
- Some sample menus exist to reference basic capability

## Backend Primary purpose

The site is build on Springboot.  The project is primarly used to store and retrieve data through APIs.  The site has JWT authorization and implements security.  In optimal deployed form the data would be served through a professional database, it supports SQLite for development and deployment verification.

## Getting started

Java 21 or higher is requirement using VSCode tooling.

- Install Java 21: **macOS** `brew install --cask temurin@21` | **Linux** `sudo apt install openjdk-21-jdk`
- Clone project, open in VSCode
- Run `Main.java` (if issues: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Java: Reload Projects")
- Browse to http://127.0.0.1:8585/

**Build Commands:**
```bash
./mvnw clean compile    # Build
./mvnw test            # Test  
./mvnw spring-boot:run # Run
```

**Key Files:** Java source (`src/main/java/...`) | templates and application.properties (`src/main/resources/templates/...`)

### Configuration Requirements

- Create custom `.env` file to setup default user passwords to satisfy code in Person.java.  Students of OCS should leave users as default until competency is obtained.

```java
final String adminPassword = dotenv.get("ADMIN_PASSWORD");
final String defaultPassword = dotenv.get("DEFAULT_PASSWORD");
```

- Modify `application.properties` ports to be unique for your indivdual project.

```text
server.port=8585
socket.port=8589
```

## Run Project

- Play or click entry point is Main.java, look for Run option in code.  This eanbles Springboot to build and load.
    - If you do not see the `Run | Debug` option in code, install the **Java Extension Pack** (by Microsoft) and **Spring Boot Extension Pack** (by VMware)
- Load loopback:port in browser (http://127.0.0.1:8585/)
- Login to ADMIN (toby) user using ADMIN_PASSWORD, examing menus and data
- Try API endpoint: http://127.0.0.1:8585/api/jokes/


## IDE management

- Extension Pack for Java from the Marketplace, you may need to close are restart VSCode
- A ".gitignore" can teach a Developer a lot about Java runtime.  A target directory is created when you press play button, byte code is generated and files are moved into this location.
- "pom.xml" file can teach you a lot about Java dependencies.  This is similar to "requirements.txt" file in Python.  It manages packages and dependencies.

## .env files

The `.env` file provides local environment-specific configuration that overrides `application.properties`. This file is excluded from git (via `.gitignore`) to prevent committing sensitive credentials and local settings.

**How it works:**
- Spring Boot loads `application.properties` first (production defaults)
- Then imports `.env` which overrides those values
- Properties in `.env` take precedence over `application.properties`

**Required .env setup for local development:**

```bash
# Default password and reset passwor
DEFAULT_PASSWORD=123Qwerty!

# Admin user defaults
ADMIN_NAME=Thomas Edison
ADMIN_UID=toby
ADMIN_EMAIL=toby@example.com
ADMIN_SID=0000001
ADMIN_PASSWORD=123Toby!
ADMIN_PFP=/images/toby.png

# Teacher user defaults
TEACHER_NAME=Nikola Tesla
TEACHER_UID=niko
TEACHER_EMAIL=niko@example.com
TEACHER_SID=0000002
TEACHER_PASSWORD=123Niko!
TEACHER_PFP=/images/niko.png

# Default user for testing 
USER_NAME=Grace Hopper
USER_UID=hop
USER_EMAIL=hop@example.com
USER_SID=0000003
USER_PASSWORD=123Hop!
USER_PFP=/images/hop.png

# Convience user defaults
MY_NAME=John Mortensen
MY_UID=jm1021
MY_SID=0000004
MY_EMAIL=jmort1021@gmail.com

# JWT Cookie Settings - Local Development (HTTP)
# These override the production defaults in application.properties
jwt.cookie.secure=false
jwt.cookie.same-site=Lax

# API Keys (optional - defaults exist in application.properties)
GAMIFY_API_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions
GAMIFY_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key-here
GITHUB_API_TOKEN=your-github-token-here

# Email Configuration (optional - overrides application.properties)
# spring.mail.username=your-email@gmail.com
# spring.mail.password=your-app-password
```

**Production Configuration:**
- Production uses the secure defaults from `application.properties` (HTTPS settings)
- No `.env` file needed on production unless overriding specific values
- Use environment variables on production servers if preferred (e.g., `JWT_COOKIE_SECURE=true`)

**Important:** Never commit the `.env` file to git. It contains sensitive credentials and local-only settings.

## Person MVC

![Class Diagram](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/26219a16-e3dc-45e3-af1c-466763957dce)

- Basically there is a rough MVCframework.
- The webpages act as the view. These pages can view details about the users, and request the controller to change details about them
- The controller is mainly "personViewController" for the backend, but other controllers include "personApiController" for the front end.
- Techincally the image is wrong, "personDetailsService" is a controller. It is used by other controllers to change the database, so it seemed more accurate to call it a part of the model, rather than a controller.
- The person.java is the pojo (object) that is used for the database schema.


## Database Management Workflow with Scripts

If you are working with the database, follow the below procedure to safely interact with the remote DB while applying changes locally. Certain scripts require spring to be running while others don't, so follow the instructions that the scripts provide.

Note, steps 1,2,3,5 are on your development (LOCAL) server. You need to update your .env on development server and be sure all PRs are completed, pulled, and tested before you start pushing to production.

0. Be sure ADMIN_PASSWORD is set in .env.  You will need a venv for the python scripts.

1. Initialize your local DB with clean data. For example, this would be good to see that a schema update works correctly.
> python scripts/db_init.py

2. Pull the database content from the remote DB onto your local machine. This allows you to work with real data and test that real data works with your local changes.
> python scripts/db_prod2local.py

3. TEST TEST TEST! Make sure your changes work correctly with the local DB.

4. Now go onto the remote DB and back up the db using "cp sqlite.db backups/sqlite_year-month-day.db" in the volumes directory of the spring directory on cockpit. Then, run `git pull` to ensure that spring has been updated with the latest code. Then, run `python scripts/db_init.py` again to ensure that the remote DB schema is up to date with the latest code.

5. Once you are satisfied with your changes, push the local DB content to the remote DB. This requires authentication, so you need to replace the ADMIN_PASSWORD in the .env file of "spring" with the production admin password.
> python scripts/db_local2prod.py

## Condensed DB/Schema update simple steps

**(a copy of what's above, just condensed)**

1. Initialize local DB: `python scripts/db_init.py`

2. Pull production data to local: `python scripts/db_prod2local.py`

3. Test your changes locally

4. On production server (in cockpit):
- Backup DB in volumes directory: `cp sqlite.db backups/sqlite_year-month-day.db`
- Update code: `git pull`
- Update schema: `python scripts/db_init.py`

5. Push local changes to production: `python scripts/db_local2prod.py`
(Requires admin password from production in .env)
